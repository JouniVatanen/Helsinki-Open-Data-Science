# Adding a presentaion of a chapter

These instructions tell you how to add a chapter to the course slide located [here](https://tuomonieminen.github.io/Helsinki-Open-Data-Science/)

1. Create a new presentation (.Rpres) file "chapterx.Rpres" ([instructions here](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200486468-Authoring-R-Presentations))
2. Use the knit() function in the knitr library to transform the file into a markdown file: `knit(input = "chapterx.Rpres", output = "chapterx.md")`
3. Add the "chapterx.md" to the index.Rpres which combines the chapters. See how the other chapters have been added and replicate.
4. Transform the index.Rpres into an html document. For this, use Rstudio: Presentation viewer -> More -> Save as web page
