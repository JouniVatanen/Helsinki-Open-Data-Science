# Adding a presentation of a chapter

These instructions tell you how to add a chapter to the course slides located [here](https://tuomonieminen.github.io/Helsinki-Open-Data-Science/)

## 1.  
Create a new presentation file: "chapterX.Rpres" ([instructions here](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200486468-Authoring-R-Presentations))  

##  2.  
Use the knit() function in the knitr library to transform the file into a markdown file: `knit(input = "chapterX.Rpres", output = "chapterX.md")`  

## 3.  
Add the "chapterX.md" to the "index.Rpres", which combines the chapters. See how the other chapters have been added and replicate.  

## 4.  
Finally, transform the "index.Rpres" into an html document. For this, use Rstudio: Presentation viewer -> More -> Save as web page
